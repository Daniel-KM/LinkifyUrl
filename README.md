Linkify URL (plugin for Omeka)
===================================

[Linkify URL] is a plugin for [Omeka] that converts an url in the specified
fields into a link via an internal filter.

The plugin is just a quick code to show how to do a standard filter on metadata
(see the [issue] on the Omeka forum).


Installation
------------

Uncompress files and rename plugin folder "LinkifyUrl".

Then install it like any other Omeka plugin and follow the config instructions.

The specified fields should be set directly in the code. By default, only the
element "Item Type Metadata : Local URL" is managed.


Warning
-------

Use it at your own risk.

It's always recommended to backup your files and database regularly so you can
roll back if needed.


Troubleshooting
---------------

See contact.
